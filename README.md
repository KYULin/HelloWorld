First test file haha. \n
Ahoj, my name is Kuan Yu Lin, I'm from Taiwan.
This is my first blog and I am so excited to have one.
I like music, movies, television dramas, traveling, sightseeing and make friends.
Recently, I had an opportunity to do some research in Europe.
Meanwhile, this enables me to play the role of backpackers during weekends. :D
\n
Keep learning and going on adventures ^__^ !
Cheers to the future.
